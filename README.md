# 🚁 Advanced Tello Drone Control & Digital Twin System

The project implements an advanced autonomous control system for the DJI Tello drone where the input comes from the drone's camera and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors, which feed into a real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system to determine the drone's position and map its environment. The processing involves a hybrid control system that combines traditional PID control with a neural network to generate optimal flight commands, while simultaneously maintaining a digital twin that provides real-time simulation and performance analysis. The output consists of precise motor commands for autonomous navigation, along with a comprehensive visualization system showing the drone's path, environment map, and performance metrics. Yes, this is technically feasible with the DJI Tello drone, as it provides the necessary camera feed (30fps) and IMU data through its SDK, though there are some limitations in processing power that require the computations to be performed on a companion computer rather than on the drone itself. However, while the Tello provides the basic hardware capabilities, achieving highly accurate autonomous navigation would require ideal lighting conditions and distinct visual features in the environment due to the drone's basic camera quality and limited sensor suite. In essence, this project creates a proof-of-concept system demonstrating how advanced algorithms like SLAM and neural networks can enhance the capabilities of an entry-level drone platform, while acknowledging the hardware limitations that might affect real-world performance.
